# Notebooks folder content
This folder containts all notebooks used in this project. The notebooks are orginized in 5 different parts.

## 1_release_rates
All notebooks used to estimate release rates and metabolite values in this project, and also to estimate the relative importance of different factors in predicting metabolite release rates. Plotting of Figure 1 and 2 and related plots. 

## 2_keio_strains_screening
Notebooks used in the selection of KO strains from the KEIO collection and analyses of experimental data.

## 3_chemostat
Notebooks used to analyse and plot data from the chemostat evolution experiment.

## 4_death
Notebooks used to analyse the results from the paired intra- and extracellular metabolomics experiment used to evaluate the importance of cell lysis in metabolite release, and then extrapolation of these results using literature values. 

## 5_sequencing
One notebooks used to parse, format and print out details from the sequencing data from the chemostat evolution experiment. 

## 9_other
Div other notebooks used in this project, e.g. to collect data from different sources.
